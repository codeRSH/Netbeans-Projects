First and foremost i want to tell that this player Sux:

## But what i am proud of is that i have done all the development work under Linux pltform. Never needed to open Windows!!

## Its based on mpg321 command line player (its a clone of mpg123 but mpg123 didn't work perfectly on my machine). So u will want to download and install the player if u don't really have it, in case u want to see this player working.

## You will alos need NetBeans to be installed your system (which you should have). Just copy the 'MP3' folder under NetBeans Project folder.

## I have tried to comment almost each part of te code (making it seem more diffcult). But if still don't get anything from the code u may want to figure it out by your own searching the book and other resources.
 Ofcourse we are going to discuss the source code later on.

## Since i have been trying to control an external process through jva and that too whose behaviour is not known properly, it has got bugs. It will be preferable, if we develop our own decoder either under Java or under C.

## I have coded every thing by hand (no drag and drop). Ofcourse only mpg321 isn't coded by me!! That way we can call our player our own and not anyone else (get rid of this mpg321 !!).

## The mpg321 player should be installed at its proper location (which is /usr/bin/mpg321). Otherwise you will have to make proper chnages to the source code.

## I have used the 'remote' feature of mpg321. Check out the man pages for details.

## All classes have been put in their respective files. This may be a problem while reading the code but i thought it was better way of represting the code rather than thouwing 1000 odd lines in one file. Will definitely help in frther development.


TO DO:

## Fiddle around with the player and try and find as many bugs as you can. Possibly finding out the cuase also.
## I have tried a lot of things in the player which didn't work out as intended. Uncomment those code and see if you can help.
## Think about the song which we will let SK sir to hear. (It can't be rock or Pop i think!).
## There is one horrible thing that happens when hover your mouse cursor over our names as given in 'About' dialog box. Why??
## A few things given in source have been made using AWT simply becuase i didn't know how to implement them in Swing. Can check them out.
## I have tried a no. of different things (which you will figure out as you play with the player). They seem to work but don't look perfect. We certainly can improve over it.
## There is some problem in the TextArea which shows the details of current song. see if u can figure that out.
## About page anyway looks simple. Can we give better credits to us.
## Try and see if you can run the code without the NetBeans.

## A few more things but we will figure it out. First get hold of the source code....

## Please note: though i can go on developing this player by my own, but that waon't be that much fruitful. that certainly won't be that much fun!!....

HAPPY HACKINg.......
